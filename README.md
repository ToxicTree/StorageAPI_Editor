If you are using gulp, browserify & laravel-elixir to bundle your project:
    
make sure that you donÂ´t require laravel-elixir-vueify in your .gulpfile and add vueify to your package.json instead:
    
    "dependencies": {
        "gulp": "^3.9.1",
        "laravel-elixir": "5.0.0",
        "laravel-elixir-vueify": "^1.0.3",
        "storageapi-editor": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "browserify": {
        "transform": [
            [
                "babelify", { "presets": ["es2015"] }
            ],
            [
                "vueify",
                {}
            ]
        ]
    }

See [VueInterface](https://github.com/ToxicTree/VueInterface) for a example.

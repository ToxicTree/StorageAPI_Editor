# StorageAPI_Editor
Editor for StorageAPI

#### About
Experimental node-module that can be added to my VueInterface.

Will try to add it as a npm-module soon,

Otherwise a install is needed:

#### Install
    git clone https://github.com/ToxicTree/StorageAPI_Editor.git
    cd StorageAPI_Editor
    npm install
    
#### Include in VueInterface/components.json
    exports.Editor = require('../StorageAPI_Editor')
